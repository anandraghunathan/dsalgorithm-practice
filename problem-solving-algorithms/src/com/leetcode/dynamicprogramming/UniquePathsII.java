     *  Refer to the solutions tab

     *  Intuition:
     *      The robot can only move either down or right. Hence any cell in the first row can only be reached from the
     *      cell left to it. For any other cell in the grid, we can reach it either from the cell to left of it or
     *      the cell above it.
     *
     *      If any cell has an obstacle, we won't let that cell contribute to any path.
     *
     *      We will be iterating the array from left-to-right and top-to-bottom. Thus, before reaching any cell we would
     *      have the number of ways of reaching the predecessor cells. This is what makes it a Dynamic Programming
     *      problem. We will be using the obstacleGrid array as the DP array thus not utilizing any additional space.
     *
     *      Note: As per the question, cell with an obstacle has a value 1. We would use this value to make sure if a
     *      cell needs to be included in the path or not. After that we can use the same cell to store the number of
     *      ways to reach that cell.
     *
     *  Time  : O(m * n). The rectangular grid given to us is of size M Ã— N and we process each cell just once.
     *  Space : O(1). We are utilizing the same input array as the DP array, so no extra space.
