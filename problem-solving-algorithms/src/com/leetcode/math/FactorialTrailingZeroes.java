/**
 *
 * Intuition:
 *      The ZERO comes from 10.
 *      The 10 comes from 2 x 5
 *      We need to account for all the products of 5 and 2. like for 20, it's a product of 4 Ã— 5.
 *      In n!, we need to know how many 2 and 5, and the number of zeros is the minimum of the number of 2 and the number of 5.
 *      Since multiple of 2 is more than multiple of 5, the number of zeros is dominant by the number of 5.
 *      So, if we take all the numbers with 5 as a factor, we'll have way more than enough even numbers to pair with
 *      them to get factors of 10
 *
